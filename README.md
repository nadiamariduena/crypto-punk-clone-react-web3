# Rinkeby

#### 3. We will then set it up to a <u>_testing network_</u>.

> âœ‹ **Ethereum Networks** âœ‹ - The Ethereum Main Network (a.k.a Homestead) is considered to be the production environment. This is where real Ether (ETH) can be exchanged, burned, and mined. Also, there are popular public test networks: Ropsten, GÃ¶erli, Kovan, and **Rinkeby** âœ‹. All of these networks can be accessed via Infuraâ€™s API.
