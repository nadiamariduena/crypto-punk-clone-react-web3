### 1. Get free Ethereum for testing purposes

> The reason why we need this, is because we are going to **mint** our project, and due to that we will not need to pay gaz feeds

<br>

**Cryptocurrency transactions** are grouped in what is known as a block. Block size varies between blockchains. For example, Bitcoin's block size has a theoretical limit of 4MB but averages closer to 1MB.

<br>

**Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's block size varies based upon the amount of gas spent per block rather than a data limit.** Currently, there is a 30 million gas limit per block, but the target size is 15 million gas per block. But effectively, your transaction "competes" with others to feature in the next block sent to the network for validation. So, your competitor might pay a priority fee (tip) to increase the chance of pushing their transaction ahead of yours, increasing the gas fee.

### 2. Copy the clipboard in the little icon of metamask

```javascript
0x56 very long code...
```

<br>

#### 3. Paste that code inside here:

[faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)

- paste it inside the **Wallet address**

<br>

<br>
<br>

- 🔴 In my case, it asked to connect to the metamask wallet to check if i was in the **correct network** (for testing), in this case: **Ethereum Rinkeby**

<br>
<br>

#### 4. After you added the code inside the walled address:

- uncheck the 10 test LINK and check the **0.1 test ETH**

<br>

<br>

#### 5. After that, send the request:

- You will see something like this:
