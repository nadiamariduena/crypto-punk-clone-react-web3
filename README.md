### üî¥ Deploying the app (regardless of the bug)

- When deploying the app regardless of the bug, **I encountered another problem**, it was impossible to see the components where the üåü magic happens.

#### the error

```javascript
hardcore-snyder-3fbe84.netlify.app/:1 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://testnets-api.opensea.io/assets?asset_contract_address=0x8Cbb2AE3eB35fB23f2BE1E388Faf6544a9D9fcC8&order_direction=asc&limit=4' from origin 'https://hardcore-snyder-3fbe84.netlify.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

#### I must to admit that <u>CORS</u> issues are a pain...

#### So after having spend a couple of hours looking for an answer (for the image bug) i felt discouraged but i also felt like i still had some energy to make a last search, so i started to look for CORS and opensea related articles, but i didnt find anything, just other people having the same issue.
